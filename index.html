        <p title="I'm getting chills">Finally, if we are to win the <u>battle</u> that is now going on around the world between <em>freedom</em> and <b>tyranny</b>, the dramatic achievements in space which occurred in recent weeks should have made clear to us all, as did the Sputnik in 1957, the impact of this adventure on the minds of men everywhere, who are attempting to make a determination of which road they should take. Since early in my term, our efforts in space have been under review. With the advice of the Vice President, who is Chairman of the National Space Council, we have examined where we are strong and where we are not, where we may succeed and where we may not. Now it is time to take longer strides--time for a great new American enterprise--time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space achievement, which in many ways may hold the key to our future on <br>earth.
        <blockquote cite="https://parade.com/573677/lindsaylowe/jfk-quotes/">
        If freedom is to survive and prosper, it will require the sacrifice, the effort and the thoughtful attention of every citizen.

        <p style="font-family:verdana">I believe we possess all the resources and talents necessary. But the facts of the matter are that we have never made the national decisions or marshalled the national resources required for such leadership. We have never specified long-range goals on an urgent time schedule, or managed our resources and our time so as to insure their fulfillment.</p>

        <pre>Let it be clear--and this is a judgment which the Members of the Congress must finally make--let it be clear that I am asking the Congress and
the country to accept a firm commitment to a new course of action, a course which will last for many years and carry very heavy costs: 531
million dollars in fiscal '62--an estimated seven to nine billion dollars additional over the next five years. If we are to go only half way, or reduce
our sights in the face of difficulty, in my judgment it would be better not to go at all. </pre>

        <h2>Last part of speech</h2>
        <p>I have not asked for a single program which did not cause one or all Americans some inconvenience, or some hardship, or some sacrifice. But they have responded and you in the Congress have responded to your duty--and I feel confident in asking today for a similar response to these new and larger demands. It is heartening to know, as I journey abroad, that our country is united in its commitment to freedom and is ready to do its duty. </p>
